.SH "DESCRIPTION" 
.PP 
\fBqp-encode\fRis a command line utility which encodes in quoted printable format.    
It can be used within a pipeline as an encoding filter, and is most commonly used in this manner as part of an automated   
mail processing system. UNIX's newline convention is used, i.e. one ASCII control-j (10 decimal).

This manual page was written for the \fBLliureX\fP distribution 
because the original program does not have a manual page. 
.SH "FILES" 
.PP 
If  no  input file is specified or is a single ''\-'', \fBqp-encode\fR reads from standard input; if  
no outfile is given, or outfile is a single ''\-'', output is sent to standard output.  The input  and  output  are   
processed  strictly serially; consequently \fBqp-encode\fR may be used in pipelines. 
.SH "BUGS"
